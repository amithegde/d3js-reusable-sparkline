d3js-reusable-sparkline
=======================

A simple ASP.net MVC application with reusable spakrline chart using d3.js

ASP.net is used just to show how to make ajax calls to IIS and use that data to plot the chart. If you are using another platform, just take a look at Home.cshtml which is just javascript.
